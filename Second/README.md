# Second Project: SVM - spam classifier
**Mark (PASS / NOPASS) -> PASS**
More info about the dataset can be found in the file *data_description.txt*. Given this dataset:
* Experiment with a classification algorithm of your choosing;
* Test your classifier using cross-validation over the training set;
* Write a report describing the learning algorithm used and discussing the results obtained; The report should contain at least:
  * The average precision, recall, and F1 over the folds. Using cross val score you can specify ’precision’, ’recall’ and ’f1’ for the scoring parameter. **I am working on a multiclassification problem so I used weighted averaging, i.e. precision weighted instead of precision**
  * The plot of the learning curve, as shown in the lecture;
* Train your classifier over the full training set;
* Use the classifier to predict the examples in the test set;
* Place the labels in a file, in the same order as you read the test examples and in the same format of the labels in the training set.
