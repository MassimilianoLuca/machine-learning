# First Project: Bayesian Network using Hugin
**Mark (PASS / NOPASS) -> PASS**
* Consider the data in the file *leukemia.dat*
* Each example contains 5 genes (active/inactive) and a label (AML/ALL)
* Randomly split the file in train and test (80% train, 20% test)
* Learn Bayesian network on train with different learning algorithms:
  * NPC
  * Greedy search-and-score
  * Fixed Na√Øve Bayes structure
* Test the learned Bayesian networks on test
* Write a short report (2-3 pages) summarizing the methodology used and the results obtained.
