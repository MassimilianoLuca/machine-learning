# Third Project: TensorFlow and neural network
**Mark (PASS / NOPASS) -> PASS**
* Experiment with a deep network architecture of your choosing
* Test your network using cross-validation over the training set;
* Write a report describing the learning algorithm used and discussing the results obtained; The report should contain at least:
  * The average accuracy over the folds.
  * A simple diagram of the network architecture
* Train your classifier over the full training set;
* Use the classifier to predict the examples in the test set;
* Place the labels in a file, in the same order as you read the test examples and in the same format of the labels in the training set.
