# Machine Learning - 145062 University of Trento
Hey, in this repository you will find the three projects I did for the machine learning class.
By accessing each subfolder, you will be able to find more info about each project.
**If you want to see also the report (pdf) associated to each project or you would like to have more info on anything, please feel free to [contact me](massimilianoluca.github.io)**
## General Notes
* 1° Project: Bayesian Network using [Hugin](http://www.hugin.com/index.php/hugin-lite/) (**I used Hugin Lite 8.5 as far as it is free and the dataset is small enough**)
* 2° Project: [SkLearn](scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org) (**I used numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn jupyter**)
* 3° Project: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and neural networks
